Created this in my spare time with the idea of making a video to see whether automated generation of Youtube Shorts was an actually viable source of income as the other 'experts' online said it was.
While this project did not take off as other youtuber beat me to it, with the creation of a full on server and month long experiment. Thus my project died a lonely death. I decided to add it here anyways
just for the sake for others to use as they see fit.

Keep in mind I have hidden my API key, so code will not work as requested on first try.
